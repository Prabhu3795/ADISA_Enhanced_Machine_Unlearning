# ADISA_Enhanced_Machine_Unlearning
Efficient machine unlearning framework comparing SISA and the proposed ADISA model. ADISA improves accuracy and reduces unlearning time using clustering, feature extraction, and knowledge distillation, overcoming SISA’s limitations of random sharding and high retraining cost.
